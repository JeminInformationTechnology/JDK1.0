SO Jdk1.0  is designed  like JAVA1.0.\r\n\r\nso  that  its  can   easily  made   connection   to WDBAJ$  security database.\r\n\r\nJDk1.0  has   Jdk  which   is known   as  JAVA1.0-Developement kit-ServerPages(Jdk).\r\n\r\nJdk  has MVVVC Pattern. It  supports   Multiple  submits   with  ASYNC  WEBPAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfilename.Jdk\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNTAX:\r\n-------\r\n\r\n\r\n<JDK>\r\n\r\n<JPACK>\r\n\r\n<JLOGIC>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<! JAVA1.0 Logic>\r\n\r\n</JLOGIC>\r\n\r\n</JDK>\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT JDK MVVVC  Framework\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe     JDK MVVVC  Framework  consists    of\r\n\r\nModules  like\r\n\r\na)  Creating   a  Application    Server  like   Tomcat  server.\r\nb) Supports  component  like   J2ee.\r\nc) Supports    MVVVC like  Model   Framework.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvantages of  JDK MVVVC  Framework\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nA)   It   focus   on  developers    to   learn  only   core  JDk1.0  Technology\r\n\r\nfor  this    framework.\r\n\r\nb)  It  is  a   Learnable  framework  and easy  to    design   webpages\r\n\r\ncomes    with   wilmix cat  server.\r\n\r\nc)  Easy  to  Learn  ,  Focus  , and  use  and  eradicates  lot  of  coding.\r\n\r\nd) SAVES   TIME  AND  COST.\r\n\r\ne)  It  is   an   Opensource  framework  but    wilmix   cat  server   is  not  opensourced.\r\n\r\nf)  It   saves  time   and  cost\r\n\r\ng) Use  of  web.xml  and  set  and  get    methods    are avoided.\r\n\r\nh)  Controller  ,Model  ,  View   are  User defined. \r\n\r\ni)  You  can   pass   any  type   of   core  JDk1.0 collections like  ArrayList,  Hashmap,etc\r\n\r\n   so    you  can   get  multiple   values   at    the  same   time   at  View3\r\n\r\nso  it   is   one   of    the  best    JDK1.0   framework.   \r\n\r\nj)  You  can   perform  many  number  of   Multiple   submits  on  the     same  page\r\n\r\nie)   one   can    load   many   HTML   forms    in   the  same   page \r\n\r\nby   calling    HTML.displayhtml  function..  is  one   of  the  best  advantage  than  any  other  framework....\r\n\r\nk)  This  Framework  also   behave   like  ASYNC  with  multiple  submits(JDK-ASYNC)   and  redirects   to  the  same   page....\r\n\r\n\r\nl)It  is  designed  like  java  to interact  with  OPLUS, S@ , H@ , etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nm) SO Jdk1.0  is designed  like JAVA1.0.\r\n\r\nso  that  its  can   easily  made   connection   to WDBAJ$  security database.\r\n\r\no) This makes interaction   with JAS Technology.\r\n\r\nThus JAVA1.0 interacts  with  JAS  thru  JDk1.0 Technology.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrief Explanation:\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nJDK Framework   contains   view1,view2,view3.   View-3   will  get   the  response  data    from  the  \r\n\r\nInsurance  form    where  client   submit  the  data.\r\n\r\nThe   Statement   hitcount.requestParam(n);    will  get   the   value  form  Insurance  forms.\r\n\r\nNormally  any  server  will   send   the   Post  data    in  formats   parametername1 =  value1  &  parametername2=value2\r\n\r\n-------  and  so  -on.\r\n\r\nSo  hitcount.Splitparam  will  split    those  parameters  into  seperate  tokens.\r\n\r\nNow   according   to  the    example   given below   String   s1  will   contain   the  value  of    first  record.\r\n\r\nNow   add   the  values    to  ArrayList  and  first   pass    those  values    to  Insurance   controller.\r\n\r\nInsurance   controller   will   pass  the   ArrayList   format  data  value  to   Insurance  Model.\r\n\r\n  Model   class   includes  business   logic   and   such    values   are    tested    using   this  business  condition.\r\n\r\nNow  Insurance  controller    will   return  a  value    and  that    value    is  assigned  to    \r\n\r\nVIEW3  form.  ie)  for  eg   Text  Box and  displayed   to  the  user.\r\n\r\nThe    use  of  web.xml   ,   set  and   get  methods   are  avoided   since   we  follow  split  parameters\r\n\r\nto   split  the   parameters   in  to  tokens. So  this    framework   is    entirely   different\r\n\r\nfrom  OPLUS,  S@ . But   any  Insurance    project   is  easy  to design\r\n\r\nand  it  saves    time   and  cost. This  JDK  Framework  also  provide  interact  with   OPLUS, S@ , H@ , etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
